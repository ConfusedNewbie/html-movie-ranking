    This is my favourite anime movie, it's got everything that needs to be there for a movie to be a 
    masterpiece. The romance shown in this movie is simply soul touching which is even further enhanced by 
    the breathtaking art of this movie.

<h3>Interstellar</h3>

    It's a really cool sci-fi movie, if you are in love with space then this movie is perfect for you.
    The cinematography of this movie is simply brilliant and the the plot is really well though out and
    realistic. The visuals of space this movie shows the viewer is simply an eye candy.

<h3>Kung Fu panda</h3>

    This is my favourite western animated movie. All the combat sequence's present in the movie has a very 
    good flow to it and is very smooth, there is no need to mention the comedy present throughout the movie
    as it is simply gold. Not only is the original a great movie but even the 2 sequels are finominal.
